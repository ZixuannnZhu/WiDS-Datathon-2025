# WiDS-Datathon-2025
This is a Kaggle competition aiming to predict ADHD and gender. Detailed information is available through https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2025/overview.

Due to the size limitation and some potential copyright issues, I don't include the training and testing data here. They are available through the above official website.

The flow of my own trial goes as follows:
1. Load Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation matrix, histogram, box-plot, heat map, etc.)
3. Pre-processing (one-hot encoding, missing data)
4. Dimension Reduction (PCA, logistic regression coefficients, L1 regularization)
5. Modeling (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Machine Learning)
